# Roadmap

## Near Term
- Add automated regression coverage for `syncControls` and persistence helpers.
- Provide UI feedback for binary toggles without progress indicators (e.g., grayscale) to reinforce state changes.
- Introduce a lightweight lint/check step to catch syntax errors before publishing script updates.

## Mid Term
- Offer configuration API for customizing control order and visibility without editing source.
- Publish refreshed minified bundle aligned with the source refactor.

## Long Term
- Investigate framework-agnostic build tooling to distribute ES module and modern bundler targets.
- Expand accessibility checks (e.g., font contrast analyzer) with optional integrations.
